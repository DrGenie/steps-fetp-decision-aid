                <p>
                    STEPS helps policy makers and partners explore options for scaling Field Epidemiology
                    Training Programs in India. It connects three main inputs and shows how they work together
                    in simple, transparent metrics:
                </p>
                <ul class="plain-list">
                    <li>Preferences from a discrete choice experiment with key stakeholders.</li>
                    <li>Costing templates from WHO, NIE and NCDC for Frontline, Intermediate and Advanced programmes.</li>
                    <li>Simple epidemiological multipliers that translate training scale up into public health benefits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Users can set a programme configuration, see endorsement rates, costs and benefit cost ratios,
                    and compare saved scenarios side by side for business case discussions with the World Bank and
                    government counterparts.

            <h2>Attributes and levels in the FETP preference study</h2>
            <p>
                The discrete choice experiment asked stakeholders to choose between alternative FETP program designs
                and an opt out option. Each program was described by the attributes below. STEPS keeps program
                configurations inside the experimental range so that results remain consistent with the underlying
                models and do not extrapolate beyond the evidence.

                    Cost templates are based on submissions from WHO, NIE and NCDC. For Frontline training,
                    WHO supplies a template for several cohorts. For Intermediate training, templates are available
                    from WHO, NIE and NCDC. For Advanced training, templates are available from NIE and NCDC.

                <p>
                    Templates are used as alternative settings rather than being combined. Policy makers can
                    switch between templates to see how cost structure affects economic cost while holding
                    programme design constant.

                    Templates that include the opportunity cost of trainee time feed into total economic cost when
                    the opportunity cost switch is on. When it is off, outputs focus on direct budgetary costs.

            <h2>About STEPS</h2>
            <p>
                The University of Newcastle is developing a business case for strengthening and scaling FETP
                programmes in India. STEPS is one of the tools in this work. It provides a structured way to test
                scale up options and explain cost and benefit implications in policy discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tool is designed to support the Government of India, WHO, the World Bank and other partners
                as they plan investments in epidemiology training. It helps answer questions such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain-list">
                <li>How do costs and benefits change when moving from Frontline to Intermediate or Advanced tiers?</li>
                <li>What happens to endorsement when mentorship intensity is increased?</li>
                <li>How many cohorts and trainees are needed to reach a national scale target?</li>

            <h2>Advanced settings and assumptions</h2>
            <p>
                These settings control how epidemiological outcomes and monetary benefits are computed. They are
                pre populated with evidence informed but conservative defaults and can be adjusted during workshops.
                Changes are recorded in the assumption log and reflected immediately in the Results and National
                simulation tabs for the current browser session.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key assumptions include:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain-list">
                <li>Time horizon for benefits in years.</li>
                <li>Outbreak responses per graduate or cohort per year by programme tier.</li>
                <li>Monetary value of one outbreak response and of one FETP graduate in INR.</li>
                <li>Exchange rate used for USD display and the currency mode shown in the interface.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
                Use these settings when you want to align STEPS assumptions with updated national estimates or
                discussions with partner organisations. For example, you can change the indicative value per
                graduate or per outbreak response, or match the INR to USD display rate to current assumptions
                used elsewhere in health security modelling.

<h1>STEPS Technical Appendix</h1>
<p>
    This appendix explains how STEPS uses discrete choice experiment estimates, costing information
    and simple epidemiological multipliers to support decisions on scaling Field Epidemiology Training
    Programmes in India.
</p>

<h2>1. Discrete choice experiment and model specification</h2>
<p>
    The discrete choice experiment presented three options in each task: Training A, Training B and an opt out.
    Each training option was defined by programme type, trainee career incentives, mentorship intensity, mode
    of delivery, response capacity and cost per trainee per month. Training B and the reference levels form
    the baseline.
</p>
<p>
    The systematic part of utility for individual n, alternative j and task t is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    U<sub>njt</sub> =
    α<sub>A,n</sub> ASC<sub>A,jt</sub> +
    α<sub>O,n</sub> ASC<sub>OptOut,jt</sub> +
    β<sub>1,n</sub> Intermediate<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>2,n</sub> Advanced<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>3,n</sub> UniQual<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>4,n</sub> GovCareer<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>5,n</sub> MentorMedium<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>6,n</sub> MentorHigh<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>7,n</sub> InPerson<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>8,n</sub> Online<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>9,n</sub> Resp15<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>10,n</sub> Resp7<sub>jt</sub> +
    β<sub>11,n</sub> Cost<sub>njt</sub>.
</div>
<p>
    Cost is measured in thousands of rupees per trainee per month. Training B and the reference levels
    (Frontline, certificate, low mentorship, blended, response within 30 days) are omitted from the equation.
</p>

<h2>2. Mixed logit model and final estimates</h2>
<p>
    To allow for preference heterogeneity, a mixed logit model was estimated. Non cost coefficients follow
    independent normal distributions. The cost coefficient follows a log normal distribution:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    β<sub>11,n</sub> = -exp( μ<sub>cost</sub> + σ<sub>cost</sub> η<sub>n</sub> ), with η<sub>n</sub> ~ N(0,1),
</div>
<p>
    which ensures that higher cost always reduces utility.
</p>
<p>
    The main mixed logit results used in STEPS (mean parameters) are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ASC for Training A: 0.168.</li>
    <li>ASC for opt out: -0.601.</li>
    <li>Intermediate programme: 0.220; Advanced programme: 0.487.</li>
    <li>University qualification: 0.017; Government career pathway: -0.122.</li>
    <li>Mentorship medium: 0.453; mentorship high: 0.640.</li>
    <li>Fully in person delivery: -0.232; fully online delivery: -1.073.</li>
    <li>Response within 15 days: 0.546; within 7 days: 0.610.</li>
    <li>Mean cost coefficient: -0.005 per thousand rupees per trainee per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In STEPS these values are stored in the mixed logit preference model and are used to derive endorsement
    probabilities and willingness to pay.
</p>

<h2>3. Latent class model and supportive group</h2>
<p>
    A two class latent class model distinguishes between training resisters and training supporters.
    STEPS uses the Class 2 parameters to represent supportive stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    For Class 2, key estimates are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ASC for Training A: 0.098; ASC for opt out: -2.543.</li>
    <li>Advanced programme: 0.422.</li>
    <li>Mentorship medium and high: 0.342 and 0.486.</li>
    <li>Response within 15 and 7 days: 0.317 and 0.504.</li>
    <li>Cost coefficient: -0.001 per thousand rupees per trainee per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Class 1 is interpreted as a training resister group with a positive opt out constant and a cost coefficient
    close to zero, implying very low responsiveness to cost. Because of this, willingness to pay in Class 1
    is imprecisely estimated and is not used for policy guidance in STEPS.
</p>

<h2>4. Willingness to pay examples</h2>
<p>
    For a discrete choice experiment with a linear cost term, the willingness to pay for moving from the
    reference level to level k is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    WTP<sub>k</sub> = - β<sub>k</sub> / β<sub>cost</sub>.
</div>
<p>
    For the mixed logit model, with mean cost coefficient -0.005, the main WTP estimates are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intermediate programme: about 47,060 INR per trainee per month.</li>
    <li>Advanced programme: about 103,990 INR per trainee per month.</li>
    <li>Medium mentorship: about 96,870 INR per trainee per month.</li>
    <li>High mentorship: about 136,790 INR per trainee per month.</li>
    <li>Fully in person: about -49,560 INR per trainee per month.</li>
    <li>Fully online: about -229,330 INR per trainee per month.</li>
    <li>Response within 15 days: about 116,700 INR per trainee per month.</li>
    <li>Response within 7 days: about 130,460 INR per trainee per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For Class 2 of the latent class model the cost coefficient is -0.0014. For example, the implied WTP
    for Advanced training for supportive stakeholders is roughly 303,000 INR per trainee per month.
</p>

<h2>5. From model outputs to endorsement</h2>
<p>
    STEPS aggregates the relevant parameters into a single index for endorsement. For a given configuration,
    the difference in systematic utility between some FETP and no FETP is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    ΔV = -α<sub>O</sub> + Σ β<sub>k</sub> x<sub>k</sub> + β<sub>cost</sub> · (C / 1000),
</div>
<p>
    where α<sub>O</sub> is the opt out constant, x<sub>k</sub> are the chosen attribute levels and C is the
    cost per trainee per month in rupees. The endorsement probability is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    P(endorse) = exp(ΔV) / (1 + exp(ΔV)).
</div>
<p>
    In the Results tab this appears as Endorse FETP option and Choose opt out. A configuration that
    strongly improves attributes and keeps costs reasonable will have a high ΔV and therefore a high
    endorsement probability.
</p>

<h2>6. Cost templates and economic cost per cohort</h2>
<p>
    For each cost template, component totals are normalised to shares of total cost. Opportunity cost of
    trainee time is identified where present. For a given configuration, the programme cost per cohort is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    C<sub>prog</sub> = CostPerTraineePerMonth × TraineesPerCohort × DurationMonths.
</div>
<p>
    This is allocated across components using template shares. If the opportunity cost toggle is on and the
    template includes an opportunity cost estimate, a separate opportunity cost term is added to obtain total
    economic cost per cohort.
</p>

<h3>Worked example: economic cost per cohort</h3>
<p>
    Suppose an Advanced programme is selected with 20 trainees, a duration of 24 months and a cost per trainee
    per month of 250,000 INR. The programme cost per cohort excluding opportunity cost is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    C<sub>prog</sub> = 250,000 × 20 × 24 = 120,000,000 INR.
</div>
<p>
    If the chosen cost template indicates that 20 percent of total cost is opportunity cost of trainee time,
    then the economic cost per cohort becomes:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    C<sub>economic</sub> = C<sub>prog</sub> × (1 + 0.2) = 144,000,000 INR.
</div>
<p>
    In STEPS this is shown as Total economic cost per cohort in the Results tab and then scaled up in the
    National simulation tab by multiplying by the number of cohorts.
</p>

<h2>7. Epidemiological multipliers</h2>
<p>
    Epidemiological multipliers translate training outputs into simple public health metrics. For each tier,
    STEPS uses four multipliers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Graduates per cohort as a share of trainees.</li>
    <li>Outbreak responses per cohort per year.</li>
    <li>Value per additional graduate in INR.</li>
    <li>Value per outbreak response supported in INR.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These multipliers can be adjusted in the Advanced settings panel. For example, the default settings for
    Advanced training assume that most trainees graduate, each cohort supports several outbreak responses per
    year, and each graduate and outbreak response is assigned an indicative monetary value.
</p>

<h3>Worked example: epidemiological benefit and benefit cost ratio</h3>
<p>
    Consider an Advanced programme with 30 trainees per cohort, 10 cohorts and an endorsement of 60 percent.
    With a graduation share of 0.95, the expected number of Advanced graduates nationally is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    Graduates = 30 × 0.95 × 0.60 × 10 ≈ 171.
</div>
<p>
    If the value per Advanced graduate is set to 400,000 INR, the graduate component of benefits is about
    68.4 million INR. If each cohort supports five outbreak responses per year and the value per outbreak
    response is set to 4,000,000 INR, then the outbreak component per cohort is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    5 × 4,000,000 = 20,000,000 INR.
</div>
<p>
    With ten cohorts this adds another 200,000,000 INR. Total indicative benefits are therefore roughly
    268.4 million INR. Comparing this with the total economic cost from the cost templates gives the net
    benefit and benefit cost ratio presented on the Results and National simulation tabs.
</p>

<h2>8. From per cohort to national results</h2>
<p>
    The National simulation tab multiplies per cohort costs and benefits by the number of cohorts selected
    in the Configuration tab. For example, if the economic cost per cohort is 144,000,000 INR and there are
    20 cohorts, total economic cost is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    C<sub>national</sub> = 144,000,000 × 20 = 2,880,000,000 INR.
</div>
<p>
    The benefit cost ratio does not change when scaling up, but the net benefit and absolute magnitude
    of costs and benefits do. This provides a quick way to discuss national scale business cases.
</p>

<h2>9. Using advanced settings</h2>
<p>
    The Advanced settings panel exposes the key epidemiological multipliers and the display exchange rate.
    These settings are used as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The INR per USD field changes only the USD labels shown in the interface, not the underlying INR calculations.</li>
    <li>The graduates per cohort fields set the share of trainees that are treated as graduates in each tier.</li>
    <li>The outbreaks per cohort per year fields specify how many outbreak responses a typical cohort supports.</li>
    <li>The value per graduate and value per outbreak response fields determine how the epidemiological metrics
        are converted into monetary benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Country teams can start from the default values and update them to match new evidence or assumptions used
    in World Bank or Ministry of Health modelling. When advanced settings are changed, the Results and National
    simulation tabs update immediately.
</p>

<h3>Worked example: adjusting advanced settings</h3>
<p>
    Suppose India decides that the value per Advanced graduate should be 500,000 INR instead of 400,000 INR,
    and that Advanced cohorts now support on average six outbreak responses per year rather than five. These
    new values can be entered in the Advanced settings panel. When the user clicks Apply advanced settings,
    the indicative benefits and benefit cost ratios increase in line with the updated assumptions.
</p>

<h2>10. Recommended use</h2>
<p>
    STEPS is a decision aid, not a full transmission model. It focuses on preferences, costs and simple
    benefit indicators that can be explained quickly in policy settings. For major investments, results
    should be cross checked against detailed burden of disease or health security models.
</p>
